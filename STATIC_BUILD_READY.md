## ⚡ Much Better Alternative: Netlify

**Why use Netlify instead:**
- ✅ **FREE** hosting
- ✅ **ALL features work** perfectly
- ✅ **5-minute setup**
- ✅ Can still use your GoDaddy domain
- ✅ Faster, more secure, better performance

**Deploy to Netlify:** See `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md`

**Your app is already on GitHub and ready!**
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/castanonjuancarlos-hue/Stoja
- Just connect to Netlify and deploy

## 📂 What's Included in the Build

The static build contains:
- 18 HTML pages (static routes only)
- All CSS and JavaScript bundles
- Static assets and fonts
- Optimized for production

**NOTE:** Dynamic routes `/mesa/[id]` and `/editar-mesa/[id]` were removed because they cannot work in static builds.

## 🎯 Recommendation

**I STRONGLY recommend using Netlify instead of GoDaddy for this app.**

**Reasons:**
1. Your app is designed as a full-stack application
2. It needs server-side features to function
3. Static hosting breaks 90% of functionality
4. Netlify is free and works perfectly
5. You can use your GoDaddy domain with Netlify

**Time to deploy:**
- GoDaddy static: 30 min upload + broken features = ❌
- Netlify proper: 5 min deployment + all features work = ✅
